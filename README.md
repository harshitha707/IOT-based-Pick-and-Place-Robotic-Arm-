# IOT-based-Pick-and-Place-Robotic-Arm-
Final year Major Project 

Objective:
Designed and implemented a robotic arm capable of picking and placing objects, controlled remotely via IoT for automation and efficiency.

Core Components:

    Hardware: Arduino board, servo motors, robotic arm structure, sensors (e.g., proximity/infrared), and gripping mechanism.
    IoT Module: ESP8266/NodeMCU or similar for wireless communication.

Functionality:

    The arm receives commands wirelessly via a user interface (e.g., a mobile app or web dashboard).
    Executes precise movements for picking up and placing objects using servo motors and sensors.

Applications:
Suitable for industrial automation, warehousing, and other environments requiring remote handling of objects.

Key Achievements:

    Integration of IoT for remote operation.
    Successful design of a functional prototype with accurate movement and gripping.
    Cost-effective and scalable solution for lightweight object handling.
